I have the main projects' folder which contains the filehandling.go file where I have written most of the logic, the stats.csv file which contains the data to be analyzed, and testing.go for ensuring the program is working properly.
The BuildRemoteService () goes through the data and checks the number of times the user has used the service. If they exist we add to their count else give them a new value which is one. 
SuccessRate() the variables builds and successful was to track the total number of builds and successful builds respectively all builds which output 0 were successful. I am looping over the data, counting the successful builds, and printing their exit codes. Then I count the total builds whether successful or not. Then I am getting the success rates by successful builds/total builds * 100 and returning the success rate.
Improving the code! Given more time I could have done the testing before writing the code to ensure the program works flawlessly without crashes and to discover bugs in early stages. I tried to use Unit testing which I am a bit familiar with. I could have finished up on calculating the time window in which they builds occur. Try to improve on the functions and variable names, comments and pair program with someone to review my code.
